"""Actions a space declares for one of its screens.

A screen can list, open and edit. What it could not do is *act* — replay a
webhook, adopt a plan's terms, open the bespoke screen that belongs to this
record — and every one of those used to live in a hand-written console page.
Retiring those pages without this would have left a handful of things doable
only in the desk, which is the one place this product does not go.

Declared in code rather than stored on the Space, and the difference matters:
an action names a method somebody can invoke, so the list of them is not
something an operator should be able to extend by editing a row. A provider
is a Python function behind a hook, shipped by an app, reviewed like code.
