"""Writing a saved view: creating, renaming, hiding, resetting.

Frappe's own answer to this is the `List Filter` doctype, and it is worth
following rather than approximating: a layout has a name, it belongs to one
person or to everybody (`for_user` empty means global), and the filters, the
sort and the columns travel together as one saved thing. Frappe CRM built its
own before the framework had one; the framework's is the one to follow.

What we keep from ours: it is per screen rather than per doctype, because two
screens over one doctype are two questions.

A layout narrows; it never widens. Its columns are intersected with the
screen's, and its filters are applied on top of the screen's rather than
instead of them — so a person cannot save their way to a column the space did
not offer or a row the screen filtered out. That holds for a shared layout
too: sharing does not raise what a layout may reach, and every filter in one
is re-checked against the screen on the way out, not only when it was saved.
