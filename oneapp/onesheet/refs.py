Pure functions over strings and integers: no Frappe, no database, no document.
That is deliberate. Reference arithmetic is where a spreadsheet is most easily
and most quietly wrong — `Z` to `AA`, a range whose corners arrive the wrong way
round, a row zero — and a module with no dependencies is one a test can hammer.

Columns are 1-based, like rows and like every spreadsheet anybody has used.
`A` is 1. The temptation to make them 0-based dies the first time a stack trace
has to be read next to a screenshot of the grid.
