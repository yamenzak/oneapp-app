"""Print formats, reached from a record.

The rendering is Frappe's and so is the PDF; what is here is the screen.
Frappe's own print endpoints take a doctype and a name, and ours take a space
and a screen — so a record this screen would not list is not one it prints,
and a doctype the space never granted has no route here at all.

See `oneapp_core.printing` for what each piece of the stack actually is.
