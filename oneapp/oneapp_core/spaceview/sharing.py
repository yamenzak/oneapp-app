"""Tags and shares, as Frappe models them.

Both are Frappe's — see `oneapp_core.collab` for what each one actually is
and why neither was worth inventing. What is here is the screen: which
doctype, and whether this reader may reach this record at all.

`record()` rather than `get_doc` for the reach check, in every one of these.
A record this screen would not list is not a record this screen may tag or
share, and `record()` is the one path that applies the screen's own filters
and this person's User Permissions together.
