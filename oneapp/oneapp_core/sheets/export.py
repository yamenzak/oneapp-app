"""A sheet as bytes, for the one moment it has to be a file.

Everywhere else a sheet is rows: the grid reads `Sheet Cell`, the read-back
reads a named rectangle, a print format reads `value`. Nobody needs bytes until
somebody wants to mail one, and then they want a spreadsheet rather than our
table.

CSV, and one tab at a time, because that is what a CSV is. Workbook-shaped
export — every tab, formats, formulas — is xlsx and is Stage 6.

This module also exists for a smaller reason worth writing down, because it
looks like a workaround and is one. `File.validate` refuses a row whose
`file_url` names nothing: it must be under `/files/`, `/private/files/`, or one
of `URL_PREFIXES = ("http://", "https://", "/api/method/")`, and the last of
those is the framework's own escape hatch for a file whose bytes are produced
rather than stored. A sheet's bytes are produced. So a sheet's `file_url` is
this endpoint, which is true rather than convenient: follow it and you get the
file the row claims to be.
