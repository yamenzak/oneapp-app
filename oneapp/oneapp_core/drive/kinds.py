"""What a file is, decided once when it arrives.

A file manager's first question is "show me the drawings", and the answer has to
be a column. Deriving it from the mime type at read time would be a Python walk
over a mime map for every row of every page; deriving it on insert is one
comparison, once, ever.

Eight kinds and no more. The point of a kind is the filter chip and the icon —
a reader scanning for the site photos does not want twelve buckets, and the
mime type is still on the row for anything that needs to be exact.

`Sheet` is the one that is not derived from a name. A sheet is a `File` whose
grid lives in `Sheet Cell` rows and whose bytes do not exist until somebody
exports it — see `docs/SHEETS.md` — so nothing about its filename says what it
is, and `sheets.make` sets the kind itself.
