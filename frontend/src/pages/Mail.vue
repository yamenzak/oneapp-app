    Reading mail: three columns, and each one answers a different question.

    The rail says *which addresses are mine*, the middle says *what has
    arrived*, and the right says *what does this one say*. It is the shape every
    mail client has had for thirty years, and the reason to keep it is that
    nobody has to learn it.

    What is deliberately not here: folders a person makes, drag and drop,
    labels, rules. Mail in this product files itself against the record it
    belongs to — see `view_settings` and the record's own timeline — and a
    parallel filing system beside that would be two places to look for the same
    message.
