// Taken whole but for the import path. This is the interesting half: it
// patches the engine's `setCell` so a local write also lands in the Y.Map, and
// observes the Y.Map so a remote one lands in the engine — with an origin tag
// so neither echoes. `drainLocalTouches` is what makes undo per-client rather
// than a snapshot restore that would wipe a colleague's cells.
// Bridge between the sheet engine and the Y.Doc.
//
// The engine remains the source of truth for *computed* state (formulas,
// dependency graph, display values). The Y.Doc is the source of truth for
// *raw* cell values across collaborators. Bindings keep them in sync:
//
//   * Local edit  → engine.setCell → bind notifies Y.Map.set
//   * Remote edit → Y.Map observe → bind calls engine.setCell
//
// We tag every transaction with an `origin` so we don't echo back our own
// changes (the classic Yjs binding pattern). Local writes use origin
// `LOCAL_ORIGIN`; we ignore observe events that carry it.
