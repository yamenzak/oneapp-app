// Undo / redo history stack.
//
// Two entry kinds live on the same stack:
//   1. SNAPSHOT — produced by push(). Captures every engine's full state via
//      the host's snapshot() callback. Heavy (deep-clones the entire sheet,
//      ~17 MB for 5k rows) but works for any mutation.
//   2. OP — produced by pushOp(op). Records just the inverse data for one
//      mutation: { opType, cellRefs, before, after, subSheet, ... }. Cheap
//      (~100 bytes). Undo/redo dispatch through applyOp / revertOp
//      callbacks the host supplies.
//
// High-frequency mutations (cell edits, fills, pastes) push ops; the user
// experiences instant undo + zero per-edit lag. Other mutations (sheet
// add, freeze toggle, anything without natural diff data) still push
// snapshots — they're rare enough that the 750 ms hit doesn't matter.
//
// Conflict-aware undo (optional):
//   Pass `getLocalTouches: () => Set<string>` and each *snapshot* push
//   captures the set of "sheet|cellId" keys this client touched. restore()
//   then receives the touches so it reverts only those cells. Op entries
//   don't need this — they already target exactly the cells they changed.
