/**
 * How this space is narrowed, once for the whole of it.
 *
 * Four screens carried a facet bar and each one carried it alone: its own
 * `facets` ref, its own `offered` ref, its own `network.offered()` on mount and
 * its own `JSON.stringify` on the way out. `docs/UNIFICATION.md` §B2 counted
 * the duplication; the consequence is worse than the line count. The map took
 * a line and Insights took a line separately, so a person who narrowed the
 * network to U6 and then opened Insights was looking at the whole fleet and
 * had no way to tell — which is one filter behaving as two.
 *
 * So the chosen set is module-level state, and the vocabulary behind it is
 * fetched once. Moving from the map to the charts keeps what you were looking
 * at, which is what "one filter" has to mean if it means anything.
 *
 * And it is in the URL — §C4. A narrowing you cannot send is a narrowing you
 * describe in a message instead ("filter by U6, then the Tuesday"), which is
 * the same failure the settings dialog had. `narrow=line:U6;stop:Alexanderplatz`,
 * because a reader should be able to see what a link does before following it.
